<p><strong>Goal</p></strong>
<p>To reinforce an understanding of Libraries using Ruby gems.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives</p></strong>
<p>By the end of this exercise the student will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find and select ruby gems.</li>
<li>Integrate a ruby Gemfile into a ruby-based project.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Introduction</p></strong>
<p>For this workshop you’ll be working on a command line program that lists out chuck norris jokes, and allows you to request specific jokes by their id.<p>

<p>We’re also going to be utilizing a <strong>Gemfile</strong>for this project. Gemfiles are great for keeping track of gems that your project require to run. These required gems are often referred to as dependencies. For any ruby-based project this helps other developers get up and running faster when they want to contribute.</strong> 
<p><strong>Setup</p></strong>
<ul>
<li>Create a new folder called norris-jokes. </li>
<li>Each of the following should be done in their own ruby files. </li>
<li>Don’t forget you can run ruby files with ruby <filename> in your terminal. </li>
<li>We’ll be making this program with the gem found here https://github.com/SpencerCDixon/chuck_norris. Be sure to skim through the docs to get a basic understanding of how to access the data provided by the gem. </li>
</ul>
